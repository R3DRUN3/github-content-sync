The *Github Content Sync* tool is a command-line script written in *Go* that allows you to compare the contents of *two folders* within a GitHub repository.  
It helps identify files that are present in the first folder but not in the second, as well as files that have newer commits in the first folder compared to the second one.  
## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the comparison of folder contents within a GitHub repository.  
**This was specifically meant for those repo that contain documentation in various languages** (divided into different folders) and you need a fast way to know the deltas:  
In this case, usually the reference folder and "*source of truth*" is the "*english*" one (for a real world example take a look at [this repo](https://github.com/cncf/glossary/tree/main/content), for a test playground we use [this one](https://github.com/R3DRUN3/content-sync-tester)).  
Generally, it can be useful in scenarios where you have two folders within a repository and you want to identify the differences between them, such as missing files or files with newer commits.  
## Arguments

The script requires the following environment variables to be set:
- `REPO_URL`: The URL of the GitHub repository to analyze. [MANDATORY]
- `REPO_FOLDER_1`: The name of the reference folder (source of truth). [MANDATORY]
- `REPO_FOLDER_2`: The name of the second folder to compare to the reference folder. [MANDATORY]
- `TOKEN`: An access token with appropriate permissions to *read* and *open issues* on the target repo. [MANDATORY]
- `OPEN_ISSUE`: If set to `true`, this specify that the script needs to open a "*synchronization issue*" on the target repo, specifying the folder differences. [OPTIONAL]  
The opened issues are structured like [this one](https://github.com/R3DRUN3/content-sync-tester/issues/8).
## How it works

The script performs the following steps:
1. Checks the presence of the required environment variables and their values.
1. Creates a GitHub client using the provided access token.
1. Retrieve the content of the two specified folders via the Github client object.
1. Compares the contents of the two specified folders within the repository.
1. Retrieves files that exist in both folders and have newer commits in the first folder.
1. Prints the files that are present in the first folder but not in the second folder.
1. Prints the files with newer commits in the first folder compared to the same files in the second folder.
1. If `OPEN_ISSUE` env var is present and set to `true`, opens a "synchronization issue" on the target repo.  
## Examples

You can run this utility in many ways:  

### As an Executable
Download the latest version and run it:

```shell

export REPO_URL=https://github.com/R3DRUN3/content-sync-tester
export REPO_FOLDER_1=en
export REPO_FOLDER_2=it
export TOKEN=your-github-token

./github-content-sync
```


Output:
```console
   __   __ _____   _ __  _ __   ___      __   _    _  __ _____   ___   _  __ _____      ___  _  __   _  __   __

```  

### With Docker (Local Build)
This repo also contain a Dockerfile so you can launch the script as a docker container.  
buil the image:  
```console
docker build -t github-content-sync:latest .
```  

Run the docker container (change env vars accordingly):  
```console
docker run -it --rm -e REPO_URL=https://github.com/cncf/glossary -e REPO_FOLDER_1=content/en -e REPO_FOLDER_2=content/it -e TOKEN=<your-token-here> github-content-sync:latest
```  


### With Docker (Github Packages)
Alternatively, this repo already contains an action to publish the script's OCI image to [Github Packages](https://github.com/features/packages).  
Pull the version that you want: 
```console
docker pull ghcr.io/r3drun3/github-content-sync:1.2.0 
```  

Run the docker container (change env vars accordingly):  
```console
docker run -it --rm -e REPO_URL=https://github.com/cncf/glossary -e REPO_FOLDER_1=content/en -e REPO_FOLDER_2=content/it -e TOKEN=<your-token-here> ghcr.io/r3drun3/github-content-sync:1.2.0
```  

### Run via Github Action
The script in this repo can also executed inside a  *Github action*, for an example take a look at the `Execute Go Script` step inside the `goaction.yaml`  manifest.  


## Development and Debug
For development and debug I suggest the use of the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE.  
In order to debug the script locally, you can create the `.vscode/launch.json` file with the following structure:  
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Launch",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "mode": "auto",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/main.go",
        "env": {
            "REPO_URL": "<your-github-repo-target-url>",
            "REPO_FOLDER_1": "<path-of-the-reference-folder-inside-target-repo>",
            "REPO_FOLDER_2": "<path-of-the-folder-to-compare-to-the-reference>",
            "TOKEN": "<your-github-token>",
            "OPEN_ISSUE": "false"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```  



## Improvements and Next Steps

- It can be useful to maybe add the possibility of comparing multiple folders at the same time, not just 2.
